The purpose of this project is to create a simple mobile application while apprehending the new Apple Swift language. This app will be an adaptation of JavaScript project [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) and will try to respect as much as possible the [specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/app-spec.md).

This app will then be a good basis for experimenting new features from iOS 8 and Swift.

The full project is available in the ```Demo``` folder and will soon be split into tutorials.
